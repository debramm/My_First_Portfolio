    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a passionate full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience building modern web applications. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and Node.js, with a keen eye for design and user experience. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies or contributing to open source.</p>
    <h3>Skills & Technologies</h3>
    <p>HTML, CSS (including modern layout techniques), JavaScript, React, and basic backend familiarity. I use Figma for design, Git for version control, and keep a test-driven mindset wherever it helps the product.</p>
